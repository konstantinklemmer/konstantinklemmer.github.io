## About Me

I am an AI researcher at <a href="https://lgnd.io/">LGND AI</a> and incoming Assistant Professor at <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/">UCL</a>, starting in Fall 2026.
My research focuses on the representation of geospatial phenomena in machine learning methods and, more broadly, on statistical machine learning and self-supervised representation learning. Beyond that, I am interested in the application of these methods in urban environments and to tackle climate change. 
Before my current role, I was as a postdoctoral researcher and research scientist at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england">Microsoft Research</a>.
I completed my PhD at the <a href="http://www.wisc.warwick.ac.uk/">University of Warwick</a> and <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/ml4good/">New York University</a>. 
I was also an Enrichment student at the <a href="https://turing.ac.uk">Alan Turing Institute</a> and a Beyond Fellow at <a href="https://ai4eo.de/">TUM / DLR</a>. 
In my free time, I volunteer for <a href="https://climatechange.ai">Climate Change AI</a> where I served for two terms on the board od directors. 

<div class="hiring-box">
  <p><strong>I am currently hiring PhD students!</strong> I am looking for students interested in one or more of the following areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-supervised representation learning for large-scale geospatial data</li>
    <li>Combining approaches from spatial statistics and geography with machine learning methods</li>
    <li>Geospatial AI applied to real-world problems, from climate change to urban development</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prospective students will work in an interdisciplinary environment that encourages and fosters collaboration across academic domains, with the goal of developing high-impact AI methods designed for and with real-world use cases. Interested students should send the following documents to <a class="email-inline" href="mailto:konstantin.klemmer.16@ucl.ac.uk"><strong>konstantin.klemmer.16@ucl.ac.uk</strong></a> using the subject line <em>[UCLCEGE PHD 26]</em> no later than <strong>December 5, 2025</strong> (I will start reviewing on December 1):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>CV</li>
    <li>A 1–2 page research proposal (excluding references), including: Proposed topic / title, Research gaps and why they matter, Planned / potential data, Methodology / study design, Expected contributions / conclusions, Key references</li>
  </ol>
